1. FFood users transiently become "dormant" users of FFamily, and the new system should distinguish different types of users and apply provided engagement strategies accordingly.
1. No technical restrictions until it fits into the budget for the new system. The preferred technology environment is AWS.
1. Integrations with 3rd party systems are expected. Users' consent, data, integrations - management in sight.
