# Assumptions

1. FFood has access to data scientists and engineers who know how to build proper data models and pipelines to get prediction models. From our side we have to provide good data + metadata about significant business events.
2. All FFood customers automatically become FFamily members internally. But they should accept additional user agreement to collect, and process their data.
3. We assume that access to communities will be bound to the user's address ([adr 004](../4.ADRs/004_community_localization.md)).
4. Assumed number of participants in a single local community is about 20-40 members.
5. Number of active forums per community around 10
