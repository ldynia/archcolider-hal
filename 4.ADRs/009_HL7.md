# Electronic Health Information Exchange

## Date

2021-11-08

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Requirement [#4](../1.ProblemBackground/significant_driving_requirements.md#requirements) states that FFamily will support integration with clinicians (3rd party systems). In the context of dealing with various healthcare providers which have many different computer systems used for everything (billing records to patient tracking), there has to be established a protocol/interface that will allow for various systems to communicate with each other.

## Decision

To support requirement [#4](../1.ProblemBackground/significant_driving_requirements.md#requirements) we will use the [Health Level Seven (HL7)](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav) standard. This standard defines how information is packaged and communicated between software applications in a health information context.

## Consequences

Having HL7 as an international standard for information exchange will set rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. Which will result with healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information, and minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.
